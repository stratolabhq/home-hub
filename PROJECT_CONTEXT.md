# Home Hub - Development Context

**Last Updated:** July 19, 2026

> **Maintenance rule:** This is the single source of truth for project context.
> Every meaningful Claude Code commit should update this file in the same commit
> (structure changes, new features, and especially new entries in "Decisions &
> Gotchas"). GitHub issues are the task queue; commits/code are the mechanics;
> this doc is the durable narrative — structure, feature background, and the
> non-obvious decisions that code alone doesn't explain.

## 🏠 Project Overview

**Name:** Home Hub *(display name; "hero" removed from all user-facing copy)*  
**Description:** Beginner-friendly smart home device compatibility guide  
**Live URL:** https://home-hero-hub-xi.vercel.app  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/stratolabhq/home-hub *(repo renamed from
`home-hero-hub`; old URL still redirects)*  
**Supabase Project:** ladpczicpuycoqcfffzz  

> ⚠️ **Naming state:** Display name is "Home Hub" everywhere in visible copy.
> The Vercel URL (`home-hero-hub-xi.vercel.app`) and package name still carry
> the old name — intentionally unchanged. The GitHub repo was renamed to
> `home-hub`; the local git remote may still point at the old URL (redirect
> works). Updating the Vercel project + local remote is an open, deferred task.

## 🎯 Current Phase: Phase 1 — Easy On-Ramp

**Goal:** Ship a beginner-focused product first. Guide newcomers from picking a
platform → curated starter picks. Advanced/power-user surfaces (Protocol
Controllers, AI YAML Generator, Network Map) are gated behind an Advanced-mode
feature flag, deferred to Phase 2 pending user feedback + sensor research.

**Gating mechanism:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADVANCED_MODE` env flag, read via
`src/lib/feature-flags.ts` (exports `ADVANCED_MODE`). Off by default →
advanced routes show a friendly "Almost ready" guard instead of 404; advanced
nav/homepage/footer links hidden; embedded dashboard NetworkDiagram hidden.

**Phase 1 locked decisions:**
- Beginner-facing term for Alexa/Google/etc. = **"platform"** (not "ecosystem")
- "Coming Soon" heading style = **"Almost ready"**
- No email capture on Coming Soon screens
- Home Assistant card kept in the easy build with simplified copy
- Homepage funnel = pick platform → curated starter picks (not raw search)
- Popularity signal = existing `products.is_popular` boolean (deliberate
  placeholder, designed to be swapped later)

## 🔄 Workflow

Established loop for each unit of work:
1. Create a GitHub issue (from the Phase 1 plan or ad hoc)
2. Generate a paired Claude Code prompt (with ready-to-run git commands)
3. Run the prompt in Claude Code; verify `npm run build` (and lint for touched files)
4. Commit with `Fixes #N`, push
5. GitHub Actions deploys and auto-closes the issue
6. Update this doc if the change affects structure/decisions

**Git hygiene:** `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored, so `git add .` is
safe. Standard commit types: `feat` / `fix` / `refactor` / `style` / `docs` /
`db` / `chore`.

## 🧠 Decisions & Gotchas

> Append-only log of non-obvious decisions and traps. Newest first. Each entry:
> date — the thing — why it matters.

- **2026-07-19 — Compatibility page has no chipset/protocol-version/connection-type
  filters.** Those live on the Controllers page (`/controllers`) only. The
  Compatibility page's actual "advanced" tier is just specific protocol toggles
  (Zigbee/Z-Wave/Thread/Matter/etc.) and the "works with my ecosystem" inventory
  match — everything else (search, sort, platform select, category, price,
  popular-only, Home Assistant toggle) stayed in the beginner-visible default
  view since none of it requires protocol knowledge. Check the actual `Filters`
  interface before assuming a filter list from a planning doc matches the page.

- **2026-07-18 — Home Assistant is NOT an ecosystem-select value.** In the DB,
  `home_assistant` is its own BOOLEAN column, separate from the ecosystem keys
  (`alexa`/`google_home`/`apple_homekit`) the compatibility page's filter select
  uses. The compat page translates `ecosystem=home_assistant` (URL param) into
  `homeAssistant: true` internally. Skip this translation and HA queries silently
  return zero results. Affects any platform-filtering work.

- **2026-07-18 — Compatibility page previously ignored URL params entirely.** It
  only restored filters from localStorage, so every `/compatibility?ecosystem=…`
  link was silently non-functional before the funnel work. Now parses via
  `useSearchParams` (Suspense-wrapped, matching the `controllers/page.tsx`
  pattern). Any new deep-link into compat must go through that param parsing.

- **2026-07-18 — `is_popular` is a deliberate placeholder.** It's the Phase 1
  popularity signal, read ONLY through `src/lib/popular-filter.ts`
  (`applyPopularFilter(query, popularOnly)`). To upgrade to Amazon-bestseller or
  `amazon_clicks`-ranking data later, change that one helper — do NOT scatter
  `is_popular` checks elsewhere or the funnel will need rebuilding.

- **2026-07-18 — Beginner-facing term is "platform," not "ecosystem."** Copy
  decision for Phase 1. "Ecosystem" is insider vocabulary; beginners recognize
  "the assistant I already own." Internal/DB code still uses "ecosystem" keys.

- **2026-07-18 — Gate the control, not just the content.** When hiding advanced
  features, hide the entry control too (e.g. the dashboard "Network View" toggle),
  not just the rendered output. A button that leads nowhere is worse than no button.

- **2026-07-18 — "hero" removal was visible-text-only.** Find/replace of "hero"
  risks colliding with CSS classes (`hero-section`), component names, and image
  paths. Scope strictly to user-facing copy. Repo/URL/package name left as-is.

- **2026-07-18 — Repo-wide lint debt is tracked separately (GitHub #3).** ~103
  pre-existing `no-explicit-any` / unescaped-entity problems in unrelated files
  (NetworkDiagram, rate-limit, scrapers). Feature issues should require lint-clean
  for TOUCHED FILES only, not whole-repo, so this debt doesn't block features.

## 📜 Feature History

> Short background per shipped feature. Full mechanics live in git history.

**Phase 1 — Easy On-Ramp (July 2026)**
- **Advanced-mode feature flag** (commit a8bee4d) — `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADVANCED_MODE` +
  `feature-flags.ts`. Gates Protocol Controllers, AI YAML Generator, Network Map.
  Advanced routes show "Almost ready" guard when off.
- **Phase 1 UX copy + Home Hub rename** (commit 015d49f) — beginner-friendly
  homepage funnel copy, "Almost ready" guards, "Home Hero Hub" → "Home Hub" in
  all visible text.
- **Dashboard NetworkDiagram gate** (commit 2479f56) — embedded D3 diagram +its
  "Network View" toggle gated behind ADVANCED_MODE (the map isn't a route).
- **Platform → curated starter picks funnel** (commit dfed018) — homepage platform
  picker as primary CTA → `/compatibility?ecosystem=<v>&popular=1`. "Starter view"
  caps to 8 devices (no-hub → WiFi → cheapest). Added `popular-filter.ts`; fixed
  the URL-param-parsing gap on the compat page.
- **Beginner-safe Compatibility filter defaults** — protocol toggles and "works
  with my ecosystem" demoted behind a closed-by-default "More filters" expander;
  platform/category/price/popular/Home-Assistant stay visible. Expander
  auto-opens (never auto-closes) whenever a restored advanced filter is active,
  so nothing applied is ever hidden. "Ecosystem" filter label renamed to
  "Platform" for terminology consistency. localStorage persistence and the
  Issue 2 starter-view/URL-param logic untouched.

**Pre-migration / earlier (March 2026)**
- Password visibility toggle; profile dropdown nav; user settings wizard +
  `user_settings` table; device example images; homepage visual enhancements;
  duplicate-product fix (removed UNIQUE constraint); device-request submission fix.
- Device database: 10,800+ devices (Philips Hue, Wyze, Kasa, Matter CSA-IoT).
- Admin dashboard, device/request/user management, analytics, YAML generator.
- Amazon affiliate links + click tracking.

---

## 📋 Phase 1 Remaining Work

Tracked as GitHub issues (labels: `phase-1`). Checklist "Issue N" labels are
planning names and do NOT match GitHub issue numbers.

- Device count consistency (868 vs 10,800 — pick one true number everywhere)
- Dead/duplicate links + legal pages (Privacy, Terms, About, affiliate
  disclosure, fix Doorbells card duplicating Security filter)
- Confirm My Products fits beginner flow (zero-device empty state)
- QA pass + ship
- Clear repo-wide lint debt (GitHub #3)
- Update Vercel project + local git remote to `home-hub` (optional)

## 🔮 Phase 2 Backlog (do NOT build yet)

Gated on user feedback + sensor research. Re-introduce Protocol Controllers,
AI YAML Generator, Network Map under Advanced mode; controller finder wizard;
5 setup guides (ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, Z-Wave JS, Matter, Thread); advanced filtering
+ comparison; user reviews; decide Advanced-mode opt-in (toggle vs. progressive
unlock). Upgrade popularity signal from `is_popular` to bestseller/click data.
